      <p class="info1">
      Our 133rd year of teaching and learning begins with sustained commitment
       to our liberal arts foundation, as well as the promise to continually define
        excellence in education for the world our students will inhabit. 
        Our vision challenges us to make learning even more personal, 
        inquiry-based and inclusive for every member of the English community.
        <br><br>
        As a result, Latin learners are conscious and proactive about their learning,
         paving the way for the development of critical skills and an understanding 
         of who they are that serves them not just in college, but for a lifetime.

    <h2 class="hd1">Community Values</h2><br>
    
    Our shared values of excellence, community and integrity affirm and define us.
     They serve as guideposts for all we do, and connect us â€” students, teachers, 
     parents and alumni.
